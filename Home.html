      Hello, I'm Matthew Tumanov. And this is my portfolio site. Now I am an amateur C ++ developer. I'm 12 y.o. now (2009 year of birth).
  You are probably surprised: "Why is there not a single project on the portfolio site?" And I will answer you: "I have no serious projects."
  Yes, yes, I have just small projects in more detail about which you can ask me in the telegram and see them in my GitHub. There are mainly projects in python, soon there will be C ++.
  By the way, this site is also on GitHub. I can tell you more: this site is hosted by GitHub. Thanks to Github for this! 
      I was born in the city of Yegoryevsk. From birth to the present day I have been living in the village of Fosforitnoye. In the summer I often go to the village of Vasilevo.
  So to speak from village to village;).
  At about six years old, I saw a computer. By the way, my parents have had it since 2002 (or something like that).
  After I took him away, I just fell in love and for six hours instead of hanging out with my grandmother, I was stuck in NFS Most Wanted. Yeah ... Now my priorities have changed slightly.
      At the age of seven, I went to first grade (yes, don't be surprised, I live in Russia, that's how it is with us). Then I slowly began to forget about the computer and all this.
  Then I tried to finish the first grade as well as possible, because my dad promised that if I write the final results well, he will give me a smartphone. Yes, the first smartphone ... 
  At the end of the first class. No, he didn't really cheer me up, because Like and Musical.ly (tiktok now) appeared around then or a little later ... Yes, my older cousin stuck there and filmed videos ...
  And that smartphone did not pull musical.ly I was not particularly disappointed and just played other (slightly retarded) games. Then in 2018 they bought me a second smartphone.
  It seems to have been the fourth grade (I was 9 years old then). It was the Honor 7a. Yes, really ... Now I hate him. It's HONOR!
      Around then, I became interested in a computer, namely a 2010 laptop - asus k53e. I still have it. Then there was windows 7, I just played CS: GO and SA: MP, I liked it. But later I got tired of windows 7, then I discovered the huge world of Linux.
  And he put it down, dad, whose laptop was, sounded neutral. I continued to play, only this time on Linix Mint. And already only in CS: GO. There were many reinstallations of windows 10 further, then I was just playing, I hadn't thought about programming yet.
  But once I became interested in programming, I don't remember how it happened, but I remember exactly that I came across Howdy Ho and Gosha Dudar's channels. Then I on windows in sublime text (then there was already the third version) started programming in python, it was around the summer of 2020.
  A lot of people started programming at this very time.
  Then I wandered into the telegram channel Open Source Present, where I met Gonate and Ruslan in the chat. We made fun of Gonate in every possible way, but I consider him fair and one of the main people in my life.
  Ruslan is a young man, 20-21 years old, as I understand he works as a freelancer, he really, VERY helped me with setting up i3wm, gave me his configs and answered my STUPID questions. I am very grateful to everyone with whom I communicated in the past and this year. YOU ARE COOL!
